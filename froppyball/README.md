# FroppyBall

Simple Flappy Bird clone using only shapes to try Android and NDK capabilities using GLES2. SAGL is a library written in order to help in this task, which includes minimal native activity handling, math, rendering and collision helpers. Please note that both the game and library was made in a few days, so everything has been oversimplified mainly in terms of OpenGL abstractions and the game code.
